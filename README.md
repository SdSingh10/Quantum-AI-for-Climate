### Project Solution:
This project aims to leverage Quantum and AI technologies to address climate change challenges by utilizing quantum classification techniques on climate datasets. The project will explore how Quantum and AI methods can be used to analyze and predict climate patterns, leading to more accurate models for understanding climate change.

Key components of the project include:
- **Problem Statement and Background:** The focus is on the significance of accurately predicting climate change impacts using advanced computational techniques. The project highlights the importance of using quantum computing for solving complex climate models, which can potentially provide more efficient solutions compared to classical methods.
- **Background Research:** The team conducted a thorough review of existing literature on quantum algorithms in climate modeling. This included exploring the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches, such as Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA). References to key research papers are included in the documentation.
- **AI/Quantum Methods:** Detailed descriptions of the algorithms and their implementation in solving climate-related problems are provided. This section also discusses the results obtained and the computational resources required, emphasizing the advantages of Quantum Computing in handling large-scale climate data.
